# Statistical-learning-Clustring-Agricultural-Dataset
This research tries to use clustering tasks on an agricultural dataset. The Hierarchical Clustering and
k-means Clustering are used on the dataset and performance of different Linkage methods such as
ward, complete and single are tested. In the next step, the research tries to find the best number of
clusters by using different methods such as Gap-statistics and Elbow Method.
